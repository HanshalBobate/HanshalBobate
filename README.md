## 🧠 About Me

- I like **systems that think**, not apps that blink  
- Interested in **AI, safety systems, simulations, and automation**
- Currently building things where **data + logic > UI sugar**
- Learning by **breaking stuff** (responsibly… mostly)

Socho aise: agar system boring hai, toh main interested nahi hoon.

## 🧪 Projects Mindset

- Functionality > Fancy UI  
- Logs > Assumptions  
- Edge cases are not “rare”, they’re **inevitable**

If it works once, it’s luck.  
If it works twice, it’s suspicious.  
If it works always — now we talk.
